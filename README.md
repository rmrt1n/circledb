# CircleDB

My attempts at understanding how immutable (datalog) databases work and
implementing them by working through [this book chapter]
(https://aosabook.org/en/500L/an-archaeology-inspired-database.html). The goal
of this project is a "complete" db with high quality code and tests, as well as
a strong understanding of how it works.

## Attempts
### Attempt 1
Read through the article. High-level understanding of how it works. Stuck at the
`add-entity` function. No idea how the query engine works. Code barely works,
db transactions work, query engine is still semi-broken.
